### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ i am the founder of @component-manager

If you want to know more about me see: https://github.lemanschik.com/profile or https://github.com/lemanschik/profile

Mainly i try to enable Browser based Distributed Builds of all Chromium Platform Parts and Similar Software Stacks eg: GraalVM

as also Compiling Python and other Languages into ECMAScript and C++ Objects using AST Structures... 


## Why?
I am a Senior Level Dev with over 30 years of Expirence and understood from history that LUA was one of the most amazing production drivers
in many Native Code Projects now i see ECMAScript + Type Annotations Proposal as the Leading replacement for Python LUA and PHP.

I did a lot of Research in that stuff for example i am a GraalVM Researcher who worked closly with a Student that implemented PHP on GraalVM
and did Amazing Results. Also i work close with the GraalVM core Engineers and Compare Archivements i have a clear overview about what
works and what works not. As also what has what kind of overhead i for example audited over 8000 Open Source Projects of diffrent Sizes like
Linux Kernel implementations and Kubernetes Implementations, I did that for any Related Project i am also deep into Hardware VM's and Sandboxing.

So a good mix of Hardware and Language Implementation knowleg paired with years of open source reading and auditing as also usage. 

## Oberservation wich would be solved by switching to a ECMAScript host as the main build engine
- Code gets more often readed then written
- Code gets even more often readed Programatical
- Code builds more often then used 
- Code Caching is always something that needs to get implemented per Project no good existing structures for shared Open Source Builds.
  - Just learned that there is something called web bundle which is even more bad again while i like the idea to define a standard to upload bundels
  - the main problem with web bundels is that they exist already the best format for web Bundels is the so called rollup Chunk Type it has all
  - needed glue code and you can generate a fresh ast from it that is executeable in right order in less then 1 ms

## How?!
ECMAScript is a wrong understood as a language when applyed to glue code in a expressiv way without abusiv use it is a Highly Expressiv Incremental
Typesafe Lang that has a Module System and can be used to define IDL's Interface definition languages like the Lisp macros from rust but we have a builtIn Rust in fact we can generate directly ASM in a much more compose able way then the rust compiler can do that. We can use tagged template literals to express code in any source form and transform it elegant expressiv. In Fact the DOM API shows exactly how well we can define a IDL in ECMAScript it self.
So this replaces the LUA Concept with a High Performant ECMAScript Host that has builtIn Compiler abilitys to compile it self!

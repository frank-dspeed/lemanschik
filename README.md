## What if?
I Found out that Talk is cheap and even the most valueable Tech info needs explaination and some one who understands it. So i switched to the What if format for my README's and my Communication in general by Asking a simple Question What if? And then answering it that shows great success. 


### What if it is possible to code Applications and use existing installed browsers?
It would be so great as you would save a whole software stack deployment that you need to manage.
Something importent in a Zero Trust World.

### What if you could create your own Language and use it to write your software?
You would be able to understand the code as it would be more readable then all the syntax signs. 

### What if Any Language could be Memory Save and also Secure?
You would be able to reuse software and do not worry about eventual mistakes of your software supplyer.

### What if the Web Would be composed out of People and Devices. 
I Call that IoP Internet of People aka Web 4.0 It is based on the fundamentals of Cloud Stack Computing and Implements simple sayed the core needed services that you need to run Cloud Stacks at Scale directly in your browser so that you need no additional domains or servers.

The People could share Applications and Data running on any of the devices that they own and enable people to access the data directly in a save way.

### What if people could easy use Security Standards without installing or learning software?
It would in fact be the basis for anything without control you can forget anything else.

### What if coders would understand how Software Architecture works on the Full Stack. 
They would see redundancys and maybe get what was wrong and broken with the web and tooling of today.

### What if companys would create value not via locking people into services?
It would open up a world where you can focus on creation and not working around useless stuff.

### Founder of @component-manager
I write the build tools and compilers that other should use while they do not do so. I also author books that no one did read or will read.
I do it so that when i am dead i can look back and say i knowed it better.

Founder and Next Thinker of Projects like: Web 4.0, components-manager (a universal component manager that even works online in a browser), next gen chromium / nodejs / electron / graalvm builds and the platforms as also soon inventor of the web-modules standard and the new WInterCG which joins WICG
with WinterCG Into WInterCG to build a foundation for the Web 4.0 which runs on any platform that implements ESModules so near every ESHost that you can think of.

ECMAScript is a wrong understood as a language when applyed to glue code in a expressiv way without abusiv use it is a Highly Expressiv Incremental
Typesafe Lang that has a Module System and can be used to define IDL's Interface definition languages like the Lisp macros from rust but we have a builtIn Rust in fact we can generate directly ASM in a much more compose able way then the rust compiler can do that. We can use tagged template literals to express code in any source form and transform it elegant expressiv. In Fact the DOM API shows exactly how well we can define a IDL in ECMAScript it self.
So this replaces the LUA Concept with a High Performant ECMAScript Host that has builtIn Compiler abilitys to compile it self!

### Founder of @component-manager
Hi my name is Frank Lemanschik i design fundamentals and concepts as also supply the vision for the next Microsoft/Google Aiming for total world domination in the cloud sector.

V8 is an advanced, modern operating system designed to make cloud and desktop computing faster, safer, and more reliable than ever before. It offers a wide range of features, such as a modern user interface, high performance, advanced security, and a robust set of applications. V8 also provides an easy-to-use platform for developing and running applications, both on desktops and mobile devices. With its advanced capabilities, V8 is an ideal choice for anyone looking to get the most out of their computer. We turned V8 with some additions into B8G Big Engine the most advanced Net Wide Cloud Operating system the first of its kind. Forget about anything that you know about Creating Cross Platform Software and run it at Scale even on day 3 cost is reduced to a never seen rational compared to other Solutions. Run your twitch, Twitter, amazon compatible cloud directly from your laptop and cache it for free on a user-based CDN it automatically scales and syncs with your user base.

## Maybe Importent writeups
- https://github.lemanschik.com/why-you-should-switch-away-from-npm-nodejs/


## Main Products
- Chromium WebRTC Platform a Chromium Server Implementation with more then high performance Offers Remote and Local Gui / Desktop Interfaces if wanted fully remote and local debug able.
- Chromium NodeJS Compat High Performance NodeJS Replacement directly Chromium based runs even in your current browser if it is modern.
- Chromium IDL a Interface definition Language based on ECMAScript Compatible Syntax. As also Implementation patterns and workflows for Polyglot Code.
  - Build anything anywhere even your own Mega Cloud Computer or CPU.
- Containerised Hybrid Operating systems for developers and Hackers that use the best and most efficent upgrading strategies for all Linux BSD Mach OS  Distributions. Maintainance guides for Large Cloud infrastructures.

I earn my money as private consulatant for software creating depending companys that want to improve build, development, security audit and deployment as also operational processes to be able to faster iterate over the software that they create as also help them to obtain data needed to imrpove the software. In general i Help them to reduce the overall Software needed to archive the same goals and reduce overall Development and Projects cost by minimum of 10x. I can make such claims even for the most modern Projects on earth. From cloudflare till microsoft cloud challange me if i can not deliver you get all for free but should i deliver i get 1 year 80% of your calculated savings as i take all the risks.

- I mainly like efficent simple reuseable code patterns the real efficent once.
- I hate State creating state without a need is like obfusication of code. 
- I design Api's that let you create more simple code for your Browser. 
- I design deployment and build processes for next gen builds that run anywhere. 
- I learned to hate tools i see most of the easy to use tools as sympthom of the bad code we created in the past.
- I try to identifie antipatterns that other call best practices as this practices lead us to the problems that we already got they are fundamental wrong.
- I Try to spread the word that Databases are hurting us and that they where invented only to solve cache issues on slow spinning disks 
- I understand git more well then most of the tools combined and i would have understood it even more fast if there where no tools and it would get shared as packaging design fundamentals for projects. 

Founder and Next Thinker of Projects like: Web 4.0, components-manager (a universal component manager that even works online in a browser), next gen chromium / nodejs / electron / graalvm builds and the platforms, Setter of standards for the Web 4.0 like the web-modules standard that shows your how to use your web browser and all connected peers like a world wide distributed build grid with Persistent RAM. Makes you cloud indipendent in fact every PC that you use is a own cloud/domain/server/identity Provider.

The most big issues with npm can be seen in my book why you should switch away from nodejs and npm




## Current Projects
- mainly working on git for the web at present as there exist no real git implementation with web concepts.
- Alignments
  - Fuchsia OS, Android OS, LaCrOS, Chromium OS, Linux, WSL3.0, BSD, Mach Kernel (MacOS).
  - NPM, PNP, ECMAScriptModules, 
  - Chromium, WPE, WInterOP
  - Online Editors and DevTools as also Operator Tools. Automation Instrumentation Debugging.
  - Compiler tooling and build tooling
    - Low Level Optimizations to take the best out of:
      - The NasaASM Stack partial rewritten where it is usefull to ECMAScript.
      - The GNU Stack partial rewritten where it is usefull to ECMAScript.
      - The LLVM Stack partial rewritten where it is usefull to ECMAScript.
    - MSON written in ECMAScript
    - GN & Ninja written in ECMAScript
    - Python => ECMAScript Converter. for Python deprecation net wide. 
    - Adapter tool chains for all kinds of languages and package management systems. 
 - Performance and optimization of internals
   - KVM Stack 
   - XEN Stack
   - Open Stack
   - VMM / VM Hardware Interfaces for multiple architecturs of chips as also data bus types and streams. 
   - V8
   - GraalVM

## writer of the stuff after 0xAA55 ....


ECMAScript is a wrong understood as a language when applyed to glue code in a expressiv way without abusiv use it is a Highly Expressiv Incremental
Typesafe Lang that has a Module System and can be used to define IDL's Interface definition languages like the Lisp macros from rust but we have a builtIn Rust in fact we can generate directly ASM in a much more compose able way then the rust compiler can do that. We can use tagged template literals to express code in any source form and transform it elegant expressiv. In Fact the DOM API shows exactly how well we can define a IDL in ECMAScript it self.
So this replaces the LUA Concept with a High Performant ECMAScript Host that has builtIn Compiler abilitys to compile it self!
